# PolarisCover
Attempting to recreate the cover of Polaris by Tesseract as a 3D FPS navigatable scene, built with Haskell/SDL2

I am a Haskell noob so it is not recommended to use this code as a reference. I'd appreciate if someone with more experience could suggest changes to architecture, easier way to do things, etc...
